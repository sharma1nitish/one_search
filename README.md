# Search Engine

Writing a basic web search engine in **Ruby** to have hands-on experience with all constituents of search engine architecture -     

- Web crawler (currently in progress)  
- Index-er.
- Query component (currently in progress)

Another prime aim during the process is to learn more about different page-ranking algorithms.

##Note

This is currently under active development and therefore - unusable. It is **NOT recommended** for use in any critical program.   
Also need to properly modularize the code, once  done with crawling part.  
Will update the status when done with programming and testing it's components.

##To run

`bundle install`
`ruby spider.rb`
`ruby seeker.rb`
  
##Dependencies

- Nokogiri
- DataMapper
